# PawTrace

**PawTrace** is a web platform designed to help people find and return lost pets.  
The website serves as a connection point between individuals who have lost their animals and those who have found one.  
Users can easily post information about lost or found pets, browse published listings, and contact each other directly.  
The goal of the project is to create a caring community where collaboration leads to more happy reunions between owners and their pets.
